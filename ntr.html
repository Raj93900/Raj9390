                <P><b style="color: firebrick;">Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao Jr.</b> (born 20 May 1983), popularly known as
                    <b style="color: firebrick;">NTR Jr. or Tarak</b>(by close
                    associates), is an Indian actor and producer who primarily works in Telugu cinema.[1] He has been
                    featured in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 list since 2012.[2][3] Referred to in the media as the "Man
                    of Masses", he has starred in 30 films.[4] Tarak's accolades include three Filmfare Awards and two
                    Nandi Awards.

                    Grandson of the Indian matinee idol N. T. Rama Rao, who was also the former Chief Minister of the
                    Indian state of Andhra Pradesh,[5] NTR appeared as a child actor in Brahmarshi Viswamitra (1991) and
                    the National Film Award-winning Ramayanam (1997). He played his first leading role in Ninnu
                    Choodalani (2001) and achieved his breakthrough with the coming-of-age film Student No: 1 (2001) and
                    the action drama Aadi (2002). This was followed by the commercially successful films Simhadri
                    (2003), Yamadonga (2007), Adhurs (2010), Brindavanam (2010) and Baadshah (2013).

                    Following a decline, he made a career comeback with the 2015 action drama Temper and achieved
                    consistent success with Nannaku Prematho (2016), Janatha Garage (2016), Jai Lava Kusa (2017) and
                    Aravinda Sametha Veera Raghava (2018). After a four-year hiatus, Tarak starred in S. S. Rajamouli's
                    magnum opus RRR (2022), a global phenomenon which earned him Pan-India fame and universal
                    recognition, becoming one of the highest-grossing Indian films ever. He has since played the titular
                    role in the action drama Devara: Part 1 (2024).

                    In 2017, he hosted the first season of the Telugu language reality TV show Bigg Boss on Star Maa. He
                    also hosted the fifth season of Evaru Meelo Koteeswarulu in 2021 on Gemini TV. Predominantly called
                    as "Man of Masses".
